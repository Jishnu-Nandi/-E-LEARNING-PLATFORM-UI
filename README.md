# DESCRIPTION

To complete the task of designing a front-end for an E-Learning Platform UI, you need to create a functional and visually appealing user interface with three main features: course listing, video embedding, and progress tracking. This involves building a multi-page front-end structure using basic web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—without requiring any backend or database.


**Project Objectives**

The goal is to simulate a user experience similar to real e-learning platforms like Coursera or Udemy. Users should be able to view a list of available courses, select one to view its content, watch an embedded video, and track their progress using a visual element like a progress bar or percentage indicator.


**Key Components**

**Course Listing Page (index.html):**
This homepage will display multiple courses in a card or grid layout. Each card should include the course name, a brief description, and a link to the course details page.

**Course Detail Page (course.html):**
This page will show a selected course’s title, an embedded video lesson (e.g., from YouTube), and a progress tracking section. This gives users a focused space for consuming content.

**Progress Tracking:**
JavaScript is used to make the progress bar interactive. When a user clicks a “Mark as Complete” or similar button, the progress bar will update, providing a sense of achievement.


**Required Tools**

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** For writing and editing code files.

**Web Browser:** For viewing and testing the interface.

**Live Server (VS Code extension):** To run the project locally and see changes live as you code.

**Optional:** Figma or Adobe XD, if you want to create design mockups before coding.


**Steps to Build the Project**

Set up your folder structure with separate files for HTML pages, CSS styles, and JavaScript scripts.

Build the layout of the homepage using HTML, featuring a responsive course list.

Design the course detail page with embedded video and a progress section.

Style all pages using CSS to make the interface attractive and consistent.

Use JavaScript to handle progress updates dynamically.

Test everything using the Live Server extension to make sure navigation and interactivity work as expected.


**Conclusion**

This project is a practical front-end exercise that combines design, layout, and interactivity. By completing it, you'll gain experience in structuring web pages, creating responsive layouts, embedding multimedia content, and adding basic JavaScript interactivity. The final result will be a standalone, front-end-only prototype of an e-learning platform—an excellent portfolio piece to demonstrate your web development skills.
